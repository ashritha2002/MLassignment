# MLassignment
we have created 4 perceptron models for same data set using differnt techniques like normalization,shufflin gtraining examples etc.
We compared the models based on performance metrics like accuracy,recall,precision,F1 Score.
results are in the report file.

similarly we have created 2 fishers linear discriminant model,and logistic regression models(Batch,mini batch,Stochastic gradient descent).refer the report file and asssignment file to understand them.
